#8.	A student has a rectangular desk with dimensions of 80 cm by 60 cm. They want to cover the entire desk with a piece of paper. To ensure that the paper covers the desk entirely, the paper must be at least as large as the desk. However, if the paper is much larger than the desk, it may be wasteful. Therefore, we want to find the minimum size of paper needed to cover the desk entirely.
length=80
breadth=60
